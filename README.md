# SmartKitchenAI – Reducing Food Waste at Home

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about making an app that helps people waste less food at home. It keeps track of what you have, reminds you before food expires, and gives recipe ideas using your ingredients. Building AI course project. 

## Background

A lot of food gets thrown away just because people forget about it in the fridge. That’s money wasted and bad for the environment. I noticed that at my house we sometimes buy stuff, then don’t use it in time.

Problems this tries to fix:

* forgetting what’s in the fridge
* not knowing what to cook with what you already have
* throwing away food and money

My motivation is that I want to help save food, save money, and also help the planet.

## How is it used?

* You would use an app on your phone.
* You type in or scan the food you bought.
* The app reminds you when food is close to expiring.
* It also shows recipes that use the food you already have.

It would be useful for families, students, or anyone who wants to waste less food.

## Data sources and AI methods

The app would need:

* Grocery or receipt data (could come from scanning barcodes or typing it in).
* Recipe data (from online recipe collections).

AI methods:

* A recommender system (to suggest recipes).
* Maybe some image recognition if you wanted to take a photo of your food.

## Challenges

* People might forget to enter their food into the app.
* Not all food has a barcode, like homemade stuff or fresh fruit.
* Privacy could be a concern because shopping data is personal.

## What next?

In the future, this could:

* connect to smart fridges that automatically track food
* partner with grocery stores so receipts go straight into the app
* have a community where people share recipes and tips

## Acknowledgments

* Inspired by food waste articles and statistics I found online.
* Recipe datasets like RecipeNLG are open and useful.
* Idea also came from my own experience of food spoiling at home.
