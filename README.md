# SmartKitchenAI – Reducing Food Waste at Home

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartKitchenAI helps households reduce food waste by tracking ingredients, suggesting recipes based on what’s about to expire, and providing reminders. Building AI course project. 


## Background

Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted by households. This causes both financial loss and environmental damage. Many people forget what’s in their fridge or don’t know how to cook with what they have.

* Problem: Food is wasted because people forget expiry dates.
* Problem: Lack of ideas for how to use available ingredients.
* Problem: Environmental impact of wasted food.

Motivation: I personally find myself throwing away expired food often. I want a smarter, AI-driven way to make use of what I already bought.


## How is it used?

* Users scan receipts or use a mobile app to track their groceries.
* AI recommends recipes tailored to the user’s pantry and dietary preferences.
* Notifications remind users when food items are close to expiration.

The app would mainly serve families, students, and anyone trying to save money or reduce waste.


## Data sources and AI methods

* Grocery receipt datasets, barcode APIs, or user input.
* Recipe databases (open datasets such as RecipeNLG).
* AI methods:
     * Natural Language Processing (for recipe matching and text parsing).
     * Recommender systems (for recipe suggestions).
     * Image recognition (optional, for scanning items).

## Challenges

* Not all food items are barcoded (homemade or fresh produce).
* Some users may forget to scan items, leading to incomplete data.
* Ethical considerations: privacy of shopping data and dietary habits.

## What next?

Future expansions could include:

* Smart fridge integration with IoT sensors.
* Collaboration with grocery stores to sync purchase data.
* Community recipe sharing powered by AI.
